# Movie_Recommender-Autoencoders-
Used Stacked Autoencoders to create a powerul movie recommendation system. Used Pytorch and its libraries such as toch.nn, torch.nn.parallel, torch.optim, torch.utils.data, etc for making this project. Learned about the working of autoencoders and it's different types such as Sparse autoencoders, Denoising autoencoders, Contractive Autoencoders,etc. The dataset contains of movie ratings. This project was done as a part of the Udemy Deep learning course that I completed and the dataset was also provided in it.
